      <description>Objective Generate automatic Red Light Violation Tickets for Indian License Plate by detecting the License Numbers using Computer Vision.
Description  In this project, I was reading the CCTV feed(Images) of traffic Junctions, and performing the object detection task to identify the license plates for cars, motorcycles, auto rickshaws, trucks etc. I have used Tiny Yolo model as its very fast, lightweight and accurate enough to handle the load efficiently.    Once the license plate region has been identified, the cropped image is passed to the custom trained OCR model to extract out its license number.</description>
